# NXPhlite-kit
This is the EAGLE-PCB based hardware board files for the initial 'lite' kit for a UAV/Multicopter.
The project currently defines:
* A Flight controller based on PX4 (aka PIXHAWK) opensource hardware but modified to use NXP Kinetis K64 and other NXP devices 
* An ESC for UAVs based off NXP Kinetis KV31 and/or KV11
